Paula is an associate researcher in the Losic Group at Mount Sinai, where she uses bioinformatic approaches to interrogate the biological interplay between the immune system and human disease. Broadly, her research interests include the integrative analysis of multiple data types, immune interactions, epigenetic and genetic regulation, and genomic structural changes. Currently, her major research areas include IBD and cancer immunotherapy. Prior to Sinai, she completed her BA in Biology at George Washington University in Washington DC, where she integrated RNA-seq and whole-exome data to assess the influence of allele-specific expression in cancer driver mutations.
