# Abstract

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Agents that induce an immune response against tumors by
altering T-cell regulation have increased survival times of patients with
advanced-stage tumors, such as melanoma or lung cancer. We aimed to characterize 
molecular features of immune cells that infiltrate hepatocellular carcinomas
(HCCs) to determine whether these types of agents might be effective against
liver tumors.

METHODS: We analyzed HCC samples from 956 patients. We separated gene expression 
profiles from tumor, stromal, and immune cells using a non-negative matrix
factorization algorithm. We then analyzed the gene expression pattern of
inflammatory cells in HCC tumor samples. We correlated expression patterns with
the presence of immune cell infiltrates and immune regulatory molecules,
determined by pathology and immunohistochemical analyses, in a training set of
228 HCC samples. We validated the correlation in a validation set of 728 tumor
samples. Using data from 190 tumors in the Cancer Genome Atlas, we correlated
immune cell gene expression profiles with numbers of chromosomal aberrations
(based on single-nucleotide polymorphism array) and mutations (exome sequence
data).

RESULTS: We found approximately 25% of HCCs to have markers of an inflammatory
response, with high expression levels of the CD274 molecule (programmed
death-ligand 1) and programmed cell death 1, markers of cytolytic activity, and
fewer chromosomal aberrations. We called this group of tumors the Immune class.
It contained 2 subtypes, characterized by markers of an adaptive T-cell response 
or exhausted immune response. The exhausted immune response subclass expressed
many genes regulated by transforming growth factor beta 1 that mediate
immunosuppression. We did not observe any differences in numbers of mutations or 
expression of tumor antigens between the immune-specific class and other HCCs.

CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of HCC samples from 956 patients, we found almost 25%
to express markers of an inflammatory response. We identified 2 subclasses,
characterized by adaptive or exhausted immune responses. These findings indicate 
that some HCCs might be susceptible to therapeutic agents designed to block the
regulatory pathways in T cells, such as programmed death-ligand 1, programmed
cell death 1, or transforming growth factor beta 1 inhibitors.
